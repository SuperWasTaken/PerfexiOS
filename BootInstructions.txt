Perfexi Dosen't work well on real hardware so use a vm software of your choosing Vbox and vmware have been tested and are reccomended.

For Vbox create a vm as you would normaly and my reccomendation for ram is 256 mb 

Then set the video driver to vmsvga 

in vmware set it to vmwaresvga 

this os currently cannot be installed.
